Saves of my Reactor Knockoff gameplay

### Notice: I am not responsible for any crashes or loss of data if you are using the saves

You should only be copying files in the `.base64` file types and using only `.json` file formats to view my saves "visually" and not using them as a way 
to import the save.

JSON files are rarely updated so if you want to make a JSON file for a save, send a PR!

This is also that the import save decryptor interprets everything in base64

### Issues
If you have any issues with either using the auto-update script or just exploring this repository, please place an issue in the issues tab.

However, if your issue is something to do with your side or github itself, do not place the issue in this repository!!! Please submit a proper
ticket to the github working-tree.

## File informations

Find the game [here](https://cwmonkey.github.io/reactor-knockoff/)

Save sections will be divided into folders, with each folder being a different session/world

<u>Each section will have folders with the appropriate date & time:</u>

`YY-MM-DD` 

<u>After this each subsection will have another two folders containing the base64 save and the visual JSON save:</u>

Text `POS` stands for the save number of that day, as I could've saved multiple times during that day

`YYYY-MM-DD_POS` in the file format of **.json** - these are for visual representations of the save

`YYYY-MM-DD_POS` in the file format of **.base64**

You are free to use any of these saves and load them into your own load of Reactor Knockoff
