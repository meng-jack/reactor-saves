Saves of my Reactor Knockoff gameplay

Find the game [here](https://cwmonkey.github.io/reactor-knockoff/)

Save sections will be divided into folders, with each folder being a different session/world

Each section will have files in the following format:

`YYYY-MM-DD` in the file format of **.txt**

You are free to use any of these saves and load them into your own load of Reactor Knockoff
