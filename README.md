Saves of my Reactor Knockoff gameplay

### Notice: I am not responsible for any crashes or loss of data if you are using the saves

You should only be copying files in the `.base64` file types and using only `.json` file formats to view my saves "visually" and not using them as a way 
to import the save.

This is also that the import save decryptor interprets everything in base64

## File informations

Find the game [here](https://cwmonkey.github.io/reactor-knockoff/)

Save sections will be divided into folders, with each folder being a different session/world

<u>Each section will have folders with the appropriate date & time:</u>

`YY-MM-DD` 

<u>After this each subsection will have another two folders containing the base64 save and the visual JSON save:</u>

Text `POS` stands for the save number of that day, as I could've saved multiple times during that day

`YYYY-MM-DD_POS` in the file format of **.json** - these are for visual representations of the save

`YYYY-MM-DD_POS` in the file format of **.base64**

You are free to use any of these saves and load them into your own load of Reactor Knockoff
