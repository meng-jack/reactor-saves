Saves of my Reactor Knockoff gameplay

Find the game [here](https://cwmonkey.github.io/reactor-knockoff/)

Save sections will be divided into folders, with each folder being a different session/world

Each section will have folders with the appropriate date & time:

`YY-MM-DD` 

After this each subsection will have another two folders containing the base64 save and the visual JSON save:

`YYYY-MM-DD` in the file format of **.json** - these are for visual representations of the save

`YYYY-MM-DD` in the file format of **.base64**

You are free to use any of these saves and load them into your own load of Reactor Knockoff
